# Python Mathametical Application Module
A growing repository of mathametical tools of algebra and analysis providing various methods of solving different mathametical problems. the list below provides the list of functionalities this module currently supports.
## Maths with Matrices
Simple operations like Addition, Substraction and Multiplication of Matrices and finding the determinant. Matrices can be entered as nested lists, np.arrays or directly copy pasted in their original format.

## Solving Quadratic Equations
Its simple, its basic but......the work lies in parsing the equation, supports all formats of equations as inputs and converts it into the std form, then provides the solution.
